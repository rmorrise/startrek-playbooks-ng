Operations officers manned the ops station on a bridge. (TNG: \"Conundrum\"; VOY: \"Caretaker\", \"Eye of the Needle\")\n\n...As analytical operations relied upon knowledge of science and engineering disciplines, operations officers often performed the additional duties of a science officer, especially when a dedicated science officer was absent.
